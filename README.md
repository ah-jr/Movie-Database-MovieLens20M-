# Movie-Database-MovieLens20M-
This project was created for the discipline of "Data Sorting and Searching"

1. Create a folder called 'files'
2. Move the files from this link to that folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I0IN8Ott7UMdHNcSxNbgEH5ns6HLHBQf?usp=sharing
3. Run main.exe. The program itself is self-explanatory.
